    		<p>Jon grinned back searching for a trap for his eyes
          But the mole on her neck was the best he could find
          She rose from bed
          With a yawn that couldn't have fooled a bigot
          And approached the bathroom
        </p>
        <p>John caught a glimpse of her wings tattoo and privately scorned,
As if to compensate for having just slept in her bed
His mind wandered to nowhere and back

He was still laying in a shrine of reminders he wished were covered</p>

He was still laying in a shrine of reminders he wished were covered</p>		
  			<p>As if there weren't enough, 
			The alarm clock went off to Karen't favorite Taylor Swift song 
And Jon took a moment to embrace life's harvest before turning it off
The shower ran and Jon picked up the remote;
He applied it with force
It was the most control he had with anything,
Even the car's brakes were going ou </p>
